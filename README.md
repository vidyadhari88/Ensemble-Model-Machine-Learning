# Ensemble-Model-Machine-Learning
Implementation of an ensemble model using Logistic Regression,Neural networks, CNN, SVM and Random forest

CONCLUSIONS:
On training the model using MNITS dataset and testing it on USPS dataset, we could observe that our model gave when less accuracy I.e. ~40% which indicates that our model is getting generalized which proves the “No free lunch theorem”
On Contrast by using Convolution neural network, the model is able predict better when compared to that of other models where the test accuracy was 72% on USPS dataset
It could be also observed that the ensemble model prediction rate was a bit less when compared with classifiers like DNN & CNN observed before
Comparing the individual models Logistic Regression prediction rate was less when compared to that of others
It could be also concluded by seeing the training accuracy that the model is getting more generalized by getting 100% trained and hence that could be one of the reason for its pro performance on USPS dataset
Ensemble models prediction accuracy was almost equal to that of DNN which was ~47%
The ensemble models overall prediction was higher when compared when compared to Logistic Regression classifier, SVM and Random forest
